Automated Resume Scoring and Feedback System using Python

This project is a Resume ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Matcher built in Python. It evaluates the similarity between a job description and a resume, providing a similarity score and feedback on missing elements in the resume for better alignment with the job requirements.


Visual Representation of ATS Scoring and Feedback System

✅ Key Features:

📊 Similarity Scoring: Compares the resume and job description using text similarity algorithms.

🔍 Feedback Generation: Provides feedback on missing skills, keywords, and experience gaps.

📈 Automated Analysis: Perfect for HRs, recruiters, and job seekers to assess resume relevance.

📂 Multiple Resumes Handling: Batch processing for bulk resume screening.

🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP): Leverages TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for precise matching.

📦 Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

NLTK

Scikit-Learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)

Jupyter Notebook

📊 How It Works (Step-by-Step):

Input: The user uploads a job description and a resume.

Text Cleaning: The script removes stopwords and cleans both texts.

Text Transformation: The documents are transformed using TF-IDF vectorization.

Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity between the job description and the resume is calculated.

Feedback Generation:

Missing skills and keywords are identified.

Similarity Score is generated.

Output: A report is generated with a match score and a list of improvements
